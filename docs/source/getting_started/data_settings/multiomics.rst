.. _Multiomics Data conf file:

Multiomics data analysis parameters
=====================================

The Multiomics configuration file allows you to integrate different data types and, as a default we integrate clinical and proteomics data.
In this context, the configuration file includes a multi-correlation section where all clinical and proteomics data are correlated and depicted as a network, and a Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) section, where features (proteins) are clustered in co-expression modules and further correlated to the clinical variables.
