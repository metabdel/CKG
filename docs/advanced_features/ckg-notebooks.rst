Using Jupyter Notebooks with the Clinical Knowledge Graph
=========================================================

The Jupyter Notebook is used to interact with the notebooks provided in the Clinical Knowledge Graph.
This open-source application allows you to create and share code, vizualize outputs and integrated multiple big data tools.

In order to get started, make sure you have Python installed (3.3 or greater) as well as Jupyter Notebook. The latter can be installed using pip (see below).\
For more detailed instructions, visit the 'offical guide <https://jupyter.org/install.html>'_.

.. prompt:: bash $

	python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python3 -m pip install jupyter

Congratulations! Now you can run the notebook, by typing the following command in the Terminal (Mac/Linux):

.. prompt:: bash $

	jupyter notebook

Or,

.. prompt:: bash $

	jupyter-notebook









Reporting notebooks
-------------------



- Use the notebook just replacing your project number or other neccessary information
- To use two instances of the same notebook, just duplicate inplace and modify the name accordingly.






Development notebooks
---------------------

- Notebooks with analysis and workflows we believe are of interest for the users but are still under development
- When a notebook in this folder is functional and successfully benchmarked, the notebook is moved to the reporting directory.
