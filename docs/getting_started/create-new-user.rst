Create a new user in the graph database
=======================================

The creation of a new user includes two steps:

1. The user who is currently logged-in in the database and invoking the commands,
has to add the new user to the system and attribute that it a role, by default ''reader''.







For each new user, an access password is set be the same the the ''username''. All users are advised
to modify the default password as soon as they are granted access.
